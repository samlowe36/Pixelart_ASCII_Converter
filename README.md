# Pixelart_ASCII_Converter
a program that can take an image and make a pixel art or ascii version of it
follwoing along with the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLfRSAgXNZU&list=WL&index=1&t=48s&ab_channel=CoderSpace to get an idea of how one would implement a program like this
thank you to Coder Space for the video
created in pycharm
I didn't end up doing the video portion of this project because I didn't want to have to downgrade my python version just for this to have numba work. still a lot of fun. I think I may use this program a lot for future things or making sprites in a test game
